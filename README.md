# üå≥ Edmonton Edible Fruit Tree Project üçèüçê

This project analyzes the edible fruit tree landscape within the City of Edmonton, aiming to promote urban sustainability and engage the community. Using Tableau for data visualization, this project identifies resilient tree species that thrive in Edmonton‚Äôs challenging climate and provides insights to support the city‚Äôs urban planning goals.

## **Project Overview**
Edmonton lies in plant hardiness zone 3a, known for cold winters and short, warm summers. This analysis highlights the best edible tree species for urban growth, focusing on expanding the city‚Äôs tree canopy, promoting sustainability, and fostering community engagement.

## **Objectives**
- **Urban Canopy Expansion**: Strategically grow Edmonton‚Äôs urban canopy by 10-20% over the next decade.
- **Tree Health & Cost Efficiency**: Identify and maintain healthy, diverse tree species that are sustainable and cost-effective.
- **Community Engagement**: Facilitate public interaction through an interactive map that showcases edible tree locations and species.

## **Dataset**
The **Edible Fruit Trees Dataset** from the City of Edmonton‚Äôs open data portal includes:
- **Tree Health**: Tree trunk diameter, health condition (percentage).
- **Location Data**: Neighborhood and geo-coordinates.
- **Species Information**: Common and botanical names, genus, and cultivar when available.

### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
- Filtered dataset to include only edible fruit trees, narrowing records from 430,183 to 49,015.
- Removed null or unnecessary columns (e.g., cultivar) that were not relevant to project goals.
- Verified coordinates to ensure all data points were within Edmonton‚Äôs boundaries.

## **Key Insights**
- **Tree Health by Species**: Certain species, though less frequently planted, demonstrated exceptional resilience and health.
- **Neighborhood Analysis**: Interactive maps provide neighborhood-specific data, showcasing areas with high edible tree density and potential gaps for canopy expansion.
- **Species Diversity**: Promoting a range of species enhances ecological resilience and reduces the risk of pest or disease outbreaks.

## **Highlights**
1. **KPI Dashboard**: The dashboard offers key metrics on tree health, density by neighborhood, and overall canopy coverage.
2. **Public-Engagement Map**: A user-friendly map for the public, showing edible tree locations and types, supporting education and sustainable practices.
3. **Data Storytelling**: Visualizations convey complex data in a clear, accessible way, using bar charts, tree maps, and color-coded indicators.

## **Future Directions**
- **Enhanced Analysis**: Consider integrating demographic data to further understand neighborhood needs.
- **Public Feedback**: Gather community input on the usability of the interactive map and additional desired features.

## **How to Use this Repository**
- **Data Exploration Notebooks**: SQL and Tableau-based analysis scripts.
- **Visualizations**: Visual storytelling for a high-level understanding of Edmonton‚Äôs edible tree landscape.
- **Interactive Map**: Filterable map detailing edible tree species by location and type for community access.
